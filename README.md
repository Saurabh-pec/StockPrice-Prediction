# StockPrice-Prediction
Final year team Project. Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment Analysis for Indian Markets. Our aimed to predict the future stock movement of shares using the historical prices aided with availability of sentiment data. 

### Introduction 

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach for predicting stock prices with the goal of making more informed investment decisions. The use of machine learning has proven to be effective in forecasting stock prices, and we propose a system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis techniques, and external factors to enhance prediction accuracy and generate profitable trades. The system aims to leverage the power of machine learning techniques to provide valuable insights into the stock market's behavior and help investors make informed decisions.

LSTM models are effective in predicting sequential data by retaining past information. Past stock prices are crucial in influencing a stock's future value. This project used LSTMs to accurately predict the direction of a stock's price movement. By analyzing historical stock price data, the LSTM model identified patterns and trends to predict future price movements.

Sentiment Analysis is a prevalent text mining technique, and Twitter Sentiment Analysis involves utilizing advanced text mining methods to evaluate the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of the text. Prior to generating sentiment ratings, first gathered data from a variety of sources, including news articles, financial reports, and social media platforms. A machine learning model then can be applied to analyze the sentiment analysis results and predict future stock values. sentiment data to examine the impact of sentiment on stock prices and evaluated the efficacy of sentiment research as a tool for stock price prediction.

Moreover, the research examined the limitations and challenges associated with sentiment analysis and its practical applications in stock market ratings. The project then subjected the sentiment ratings to machine learning algorithms to predict future stock values. Various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were used to evaluate the model's performance.
